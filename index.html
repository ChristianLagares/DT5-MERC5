<a id="our-core-values" class="anchor" href="#our-core-values" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Our Core Values</h2>

<p>We believe design and the experience associated with it should be as simple as it is powerful. Design should be developed <strong>around the people</strong>, <strong>for the people</strong> and, ultimately, <strong>by people understanding the true needs</strong> of the End-User. Design, as many other things in life, is meant to be beautifully simple and, yet, powerful enough to make an impact on society.      </p>

<h3>
<a id="what-is-design-thinking" class="anchor" href="#what-is-design-thinking" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is Design Thinking?</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.ideo.com/about/">Design thinking</a> according to Tim Brown, President and CEO of IDEO is “a human-centered approach to innovation that draws from the designer's toolkit to integrate the needs of people, the possibilities of technology, and the requirements for business success.”      </p>

<h3>
<a id="design-thinking-in-our-core-values" class="anchor" href="#design-thinking-in-our-core-values" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Design Thinking in our Core Values</h3>

<p>We believe the true necessities of human beings should be addressed through any means available. Our philosophy and core values envision people living the lives they were born to live, and not the lives they have to live because of their current, unmet needs.      </p>

<p>We are rebuilding a world that has deviated from its beauty into a chaos. Rebuilding takes time, but we are doing it, one human at a time...   </p>
